# Introduction

**SparkyJr.** is a programmable RGB LED mod companion light up activation controller for arcade pushbuttons on gaming fightsticks.

The hardware is based on AVR microcontrollers and programmed via [AVR Studio](http://www.atmel.ca/microsite/atmel_studio6/) or the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

##Software
####![Arduino icon](images/arduino.png =25x) Arduino

**SparkyJr.** Arduino based files are located in the *[arduino](https://github.com/32teeth/SparkyJr/tree/gh-pages/arduino/Sparky)* folder

This includes all the files required to upload to your specific AVR chipset.

**SparkyJr** only has one library dependency. We make use of the [EEPROMx](https://github.com/autohome/autohome-arduino/tree/master/libraries/EEPROMx) library

*for help on installing libraries into the Arduino IDE, please visit the [how to](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) on the Arduino site

**SparkyJr.** Processing based files are located in the *[processing](https://github.com/32teeth/SparkyJr/tree/gh-pages/processing)* folder

This includes all the files required to run the configurator.
